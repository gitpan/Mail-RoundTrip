Mail-RoundTrip

Mail-RoundTrip provides a basic framework for doing "round-trip" mail validation
where a user of a service is sent an email with a link to click, or is expected
to reply to the email, as a condition for activating a service.  Such validates
not only that the email is valid (a test for which there are better tools 
already available) but also that it exists and that the purported user actually
has access to it.  As such it is useful as a way to cut down spam during 
registration and much more.
